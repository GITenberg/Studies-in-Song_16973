<span class="i0">Five years beyond an hundred years have seen<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their winters, white as faith's and age's hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Melt, smiling through brief tears that broke between,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And hope's young conquering colours reared anew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since, on the day whose edge for kings made keen<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Smote sharper once than ever storm-wind blew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A head predestined for the girdling green<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That laughs at lightning all the seasons through,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Nor frost or change can sunder<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Its crown untouched of thunder<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Leaf from least leaf of all its leaves that grew<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Alone for brows too bold<br /></span>
<span class="i6">For storm to sear of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Elect to shine in time's eternal view,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Rose on the verge of radiant life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the winds and sunbeams mingling love with strife.<br /></span>

<h5><a name="stanza2" id="stanza2"></a>2.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>
<span class="i0">The darkling day that gave its bloodred birth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To Milton's white republic undefiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That might endure so few fleet years on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bore in him likewise as divine a child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But born not less for crowns of love and mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of palm and myrtle passionate and mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The leaf that girds about with gentler girth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The brow steel-bound in battle, and the wild<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Soft spray that flowers above<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The flower-soft hair of love;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the white lips of wayworn winter smiled<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And grew serene as spring's<br /></span>
<span class="i6">When with stretched clouds like wings<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or wings like drift of snow-clouds massed and piled<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The godlike giant, softening, spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shadow of stormy shelter round the new-born head.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p><a name="page8" id="page8"></a></p>
<span class="i0">And o'er it brightening bowed the wild-haired hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And touched his tongue with honey and with fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breathed between his lips the note of power<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That makes of all the winds of heaven a lyre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose strings are stretched from topmost peaks that tower<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To softest springs of waters that suspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sounds too dim to shake the lowliest flower<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Breathless with hope and dauntless with desire:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And bright before his face<br /></span>
<span class="i6">That Hour became a Grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As in the light of their Athenian quire<br /></span>
<span class="i6">When the Hours before the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And Graces were made one,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Called by sweet Love down from the aerial gyre<br /></span>
<span class="i4">By one dear name of natural joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear on her bright breast from heaven a heaven-born boy.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ere light could kiss the little lids in sunder<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or love could lift them for the sun to smite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fiery birth-star as a sign of wonder<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had risen, perplexing the presageful night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shadow and glory around her sphere and under<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And portents prophesying by sound and sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half the sound was song and half was thunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And half his life of lightning, half of light:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And in the soft clenched hand<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Shone like a burning brand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A shadowy sword for swordless fields of fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Wrought only for such lord<br /></span>
<span class="i6">As so may wield the sword<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That all things ill be put to fear and flight<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Even at the flash and sweep and gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one swift stroke beheld but in a shuddering dream.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like the sun's rays that blind the night's wild beasts<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sword of song shines as the swordsman sings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the west wind's verge even to the arduous east's<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The splendour of the shadow that it flings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes fire and storm in heaven above the feasts<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of men fulfilled with food of evil things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strikes dumb the lying and hungering lips of priests,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Smites dead the slaying and ravening hands of kings;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Turns dark the lamp's hot light,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And turns the darkness bright<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As with the shadow of dawn's reverberate wings;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And far before its way<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Heaven, yearning toward the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shines with its thunder and round its lightning rings;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And never hand yet earlier played<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that keen sword whose hilt is cloud, and fire its blade.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As dropping flakes of honey-heavy dew<br /></span>
<span class="i2">More soft than slumber's, fell the first note's sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From strings the swift young hand strayed lightlier through<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than leaves through calm air wheeling toward the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stray down the drifting wind when skies are blue<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor yet the wings of latter winds unbound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere winter loosen all the &AElig;olian crew<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With storm unleashed behind them like a hound.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">As lightly rose and sank<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Beside a green-flowered bank<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The clear first notes his burning boyhood found<br /></span>
<span class="i6">To sing her sacred praise<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Love that wipes off the miry stains and gory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Time's worn feet, besmirched on bloodred ways,<br /></span>

<h4>FROM</h4>

<h2>ARISTOPHANES</h2>

<p class="centre"><i>Attempted in English verse after the original metre.</i><a name="page68" id="page68"></a></p>


<p>I was allured into the audacity of this experiment by consideration of a
fact which hitherto does not seem to have been taken into consideration
by any translator of the half divine humourist in whose incomparable
genius the highest qualities of Rabelais were fused and harmonized with
the supremest gifts of Shelley: namely, that his marvellous metrical
invention of the anap&aelig;stic heptameter was almost exactly reproducible in
a language to which all variations and combinations of anap&aelig;stic,
iambic, or trochaic metre are as natural and pliable as all dactylic and
spondaic forms of verse are unnatural and abhorrent. As it happens, this
highest central interlude of a most adorable masterpiece is as easy to
detach from its dramatic setting, and even from its lyrical context, as
it was easy to give line for line of it in English. In two metrical
points only does my version vary from the verbal pattern of the
original. I have of course added rhymes, and double rhymes, as necessary
makeweights for the imperfection of an otherwise inadequate language;
and equally of course I have not attempted the impossible and
undesirable task of reproducing the rare exceptional effect of a line
overcharged on purpose with a preponderance of heavy-footed spondees:
and this for the obvious reason that even if such a line&mdash;which I
doubt&mdash;could be exactly represented, foot by foot and pause for pause,
in English, this English line would no more be a verse in any proper
sense of the word than is the line I am writing at this moment. And my
main intention, or at least my main desire, in the undertaking of this
brief adventure, was to renew as far as possible for English ears the
music of this resonant and triumphant metre, which goes ringing at full
gallop as of horses who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">'dance as 'twere to the music<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their own hoofs make.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I would not seem over curious in search of an apt or inapt quotation:
but nothing can be fitter than a verse of Shakespeare's to praise at
once and to describe the most typical verse of Aristophanes.<a name="page69" id="page69"></a></p>

<h3><i>THE BIRDS.</i></h3>

<h4>(685-723.)</h4>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come on then, ye dwellers by nature in darkness, and like to the leaves' generations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That are little of might, that are moulded of mire, unenduring and shadowlike nations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor plumeless ephemerals, comfortless mortals, as visions of creatures fast fleeing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lift up your mind unto us that are deathless, and dateless the date of our being:<br /><a name="page70" id="page70"></a></span>
<span class="i0">Us, children of heaven, us, ageless for aye, us, all of whose thoughts are eternal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ye may from henceforth, having heard of us all things aright as to matters supernal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the being of birds and beginning of gods, and of streams, and the dark beyond reaching,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Truthfully knowing aright, in my name bid Prodicus pack with his preaching.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">It was Chaos and Night at the first, and the blackness of darkness, and hell's broad border,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth was not, nor air, neither heaven; when in depths of the womb of the dark without order<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First thing first-born of the black-plumed Night was a wind-egg hatched in her bosom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence timely with seasons revolving again sweet Love burst out as a blossom,<br /><a name="page71" id="page71"></a></span>
<span class="i0">Gold wings glittering forth of his back, like whirlwinds gustily turning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, after his wedlock with Chaos, whose wings are of darkness, in hell broad-burning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his nestlings begat him the race of us first, and upraised us to light new-lighted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And before this was not the race of the gods, until all things by Love were united;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of kind united with kind in communion of nature the sky and the sea are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought forth, and the earth, and the race of the gods everlasting and blest. So that we are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far away the most ancient of all things blest. And that we are of Love's generation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are manifest manifold signs. We have wings, and with us have the Loves
habitation;<br /><a name="page72" id="page72"></a></span>
<span class="i0">And manifold fair young folk that forswore love once, ere the bloom of them ended,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have the men that pursued and desired them subdued, by the help of us only befriended,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such baits as a quail, a flamingo, a goose, or a cock's comb staring and splendid.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">All best good things that befall men come from us birds, as is plain to all reason:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For first we proclaim and make known to them spring, and the winter and autumn in season;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid sow, when the crane starts clanging for Afric, in shrill-voiced emigrant number,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calls to the pilot to hang up his rudder again for the season, and slumber;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then weave a cloak for Orestes the thief, lest he strip men of theirs if it
freezes.<br /><a name="page73" id="page73"></a></span>
<span class="i0">And again thereafter the kite reappearing announces a change in the breezes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that here is the season for shearing your sheep of their spring wool. Then does the swallow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give you notice to sell your greatcoat, and provide something light for the heat that's to follow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus are we as Ammon or Delphi unto you, Dodona, nay, Ph&oelig;bus Apollo.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, as first ye come all to get auguries of birds, even such is in all things your carriage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be the matter a matter of trade, or of earning your bread, or of any one's marriage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all things ye lay to the charge of a bird that belong to discerning prediction:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winged fame is a bird, as you reckon: you sneeze, and the sign's as a bird for
conviction:<br /><a name="page74" id="page74"></a></span>
<span class="i0">All tokens are 'birds' with you&mdash;sounds too, and lackeys, and donkeys. Then must it not follow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we ARE to you all as the manifest godhead that speaks in prophetic Apollo?<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Over two shadowless waters, adrift as a pinnace in peril,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hangs as in heavy suspense, charged with irresolute light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softly the soul of the sunset upholden awhile on the sterile<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Waves and wastes of the land, half repossessed by the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inland glimmer the shallows asleep and afar in the breathless<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Twilight: yonder the depths darken afar and asleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly the semblance of death out of heaven descends on the deathless<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Waters: hardly the light lives on the face of the deep&mdash;<a name="page110" id="page110"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hardly, but here for awhile. All over the grey soft shallow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hover the colours and clouds of the twilight, void of a star.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a bird unfledged is the broad-winged night, whose winglets are callow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet, but soon with their plumes will she cover her brood from afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cover the brood of her worlds that cumber the skies with their blossom<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thick as the darkness of leaf-shadowed spring is encumbered with flowers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">World upon world is enwound in the bountiful girth of her bosom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Warm and lustrous with life lovely to look on as ours.<a name="page111" id="page111"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still is the sunset adrift as a spirit in doubt that dissembles<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still with itself, being sick of division and dimmed by dismay&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, not so; but with love and delight beyond passion it trembles,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fearful and fain of the night, lovely with love of the day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fain and fearful of rest that is like unto death, and begotten<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Out of the womb of the tomb, born of the seed of the grave:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lovely with shadows of loves that are only not wholly forgotten,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Only not wholly suppressed by the dark as a wreck by the wave.<a name="page112" id="page112"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still there linger the loves of the morning and noon, in a vision<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Blindly beheld, but in vain: ghosts that are tired, and would rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the glories beloved of the night rise all too dense for division,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Deep in the depth of her breast sheltered as doves in a nest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fainter the beams of the loves of the daylight season enkindled<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wane, and the memories of hours that were fair with the love of them fade:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loftier, aloft of the lights of the sunset stricken and dwindled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gather the signs of the love at the heart of the night new-made.<a name="page113" id="page113"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">New-made night, new-born of the sunset, immeasurable, endless,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Opens the secret of love hid from of old in her heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the deep sweet heart full-charged with faultless love of the friendless<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Spirits of men that are eased when the wheels of the sun depart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still is the sunset afloat as a ship on the waters upholden<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Full-sailed, wide-winged, poised softly for ever asway&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, not so, but at least for a little, awhile at the golden<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Limit of arching air fain for an hour to delay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here on the bar of the sand-bank, steep yet aslope to the gleaming<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Waste of the water without, waste of the water within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lights overhead and lights underneath seem doubtfully dreaming<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whether the day be done, whether the night may begin.<a name="page114" id="page114"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far and afar and farther again they falter and hover,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Warm on the water and deep in the sky and pale on the cloud:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Colder again and slowly remoter, afraid to recover<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Breath, yet fain to revive, as it seems, from the skirt of the shroud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faintly the heartbeats shorten and pause of the light in the westward<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Heaven, as eastward quicken the paces of star upon star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurried and eager of life as a child that strains to the breast-ward<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Eagerly, yearning forth of the deeps where the ways of them are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad of the glory of the gift of their life and the wealth of its wonder,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fain of the night and the sea and the sweet wan face of the earth.<a name="page115" id="page115"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over them air grows deeper, intense with delight in them: under<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Things are thrilled in their sleep as with sense of a sure new birth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here by the sand-bank watching, with eyes on the sea-line, stranger<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grows to me also the weight of the sea-ridge gazed on of me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavily heaped up, changefully changeless, void though of danger<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Void not of menace, but full of the might of the dense dull sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like as the wave is before me, behind is the bank deep-drifted;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yellow and thick as the bank is behind me in front is the wave.<a name="page116" id="page116"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the wall of a prison imprisoning the mere is the girth of it lifted:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But the rampire of water in front is erect as the wall of a grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the crests of it crumble and topple and change, but the wall is not broken:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Standing still dry-shod, I see it as higher than my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moving inland alway again, reared up as in token<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still of impending wrath still in the foam of it shed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even in the pauses between them, dividing the rollers in sunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">High overhead seems ever the sea-line fixed as a mark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the shore where I stand as a valley beholden of hills whence thunder<a name="page117" id="page117"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cloud and torrent and storm, darkening the depths of the dark.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to the sea, not upon it or over it, upward from under<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seems he to gaze, whose eyes yearn after it here from the shore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wall of turbid water, aslope to the wide sky's wonder<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of colour and cloud, it climbs, or spreads as a slanted floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the large lights change on the face of the mere like things that were living,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Winged and wonderful, beams like as birds are that pass and are free:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the light is dense as darkness, a gift withheld in the giving,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That lies as dead on the fierce dull face of the landward sea.<a name="page118" id="page118"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stained and stifled and soiled, made earthier than earth is and duller,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grimly she puts back light as rejected, a thing put away:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No transparent rapture, a molten music of colour;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No translucent love taken and given of the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fettered and marred and begrimed is the light's live self on her falling,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As the light of a man's life lighted the fume of a dungeon mars:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only she knows of the wind, when her wrath gives ear to him calling;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The delight of the light she knows not, nor answers the sun or the stars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love she hath none to return for the luminous love of their giving:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">None to reflect from the bitter and shallow response of her heart<a name="page119" id="page119"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yearly she feeds on her dead, yet herself seems dead and not living,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or confused as a soul heavy-laden with trouble that will not depart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the sound of her speech to the darkness the moan of her evil remorse is,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Haply, for strong ships gnawed by the dog-toothed sea-bank's fang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trampled to death by the rage of the feet of her foam-lipped horses<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose manes are yellow as plague, and as ensigns of pestilence hang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wave in the foul faint air of the breath of a death-stricken city;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So menacing heaves she the manes of her rollers knotted with sand,<a name="page120" id="page120"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discoloured, opaque, suspended in sign as of strength without pity,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That shake with flameless thunder the low long length of the strand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, far off in the farther extreme of the shore as it lengthens<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Northward, lonely for miles, ere ever a village begin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the lapsing land that recedes as the growth of the strong sea strengthens<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shoreward, thrusting further and further its outworks in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in Shakespeare's vision, a flower of her kin forsaken,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lay in her golden raiment alone on the wild wave's edge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely by no shore else, but here on the bank storm-shaken,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Perdita, bright as a dew-drop engilt of the sun on the sedge.<a name="page121" id="page121"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here on a shore unbeheld of his eyes in a dream he beheld her<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Outcast, fair as a fairy, the child of a far-off king:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over the babe-flower gently the head of a pastoral elder<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bowed, compassionate, hoar as the hawthorn-blossom in spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kind as harvest in autumn: a shelter of shade on the lonely<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shelterless unknown shore scourged of implacable waves:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, where the wind walks royal, alone in his kingdom, and only<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sounds to the sedges a wail as of triumph that conquers and craves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these waters and wastes are his empire of old, and awaken<a name="page122" id="page122"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i2">From barren and stagnant slumber at only the sound of his breath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the hunger is eased not that aches in his heart, nor the goal overtaken<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That his wide wings yearn for and labour as hearts that yearn after death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the solitude sighs and expects with a blind expectation<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Somewhat unknown of its own sad heart, grown heart-sick of strife:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till sometime its wild heart maddens, and moans, and the vast ululation<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Takes wing with the clouds on the waters, and wails to be quit of its life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the spirit and soul of the waste is the wind, and his wings with their waving<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Darken and lighten the darkness and light of it thickened or thinned;<a name="page123" id="page123"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the heart that impels them is even as a conqueror's insatiably craving<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That victory can fill not, as power cannot satiate the want of the wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these moorlands and marshes are full of his might, and oppose not<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Aught of defence nor of barrier, of forest or precipice piled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the will of the wind works ever as his that desires what he knows not,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the wail of his want unfulfilled is as one making moan for her child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cry of his triumph is even as the crying of hunger that maddens<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The heart of a strong man aching in vain as the wind's heart aches<a name="page124" id="page124"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sadness itself of the land for its infinite solitude saddens<br /></span>
<span class="i2">More for the sound than the silence athirst for the sound that slakes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sunset at last and the twilight are dead: and the darkness is breathless<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With fear of the wind's breath rising that seems and seems not to sleep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a sense of the sound of it alway, a spirit unsleeping and deathless,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ghost or God, evermore moves on the face of the
deep.<a name="page125" id="page125"></a><a name="page127" id="page127"></a><br /></span>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
